# FINAL PROJECT: Aircraft Damage Classification & Captioning

This project combines **deep learning-based image classification** with **transformer-powered image captioning** to analyze and describe aircraft damage. It leverages transfer learning via VGG16 to classify damage types (crack vs dent), and uses the BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining) model to generate descriptive captions for each image.
